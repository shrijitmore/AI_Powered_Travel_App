TravelQuest AI ‚Äì Repo Analysis + Extensions + Clean Documentation

Summary
- Backend (FastAPI + MongoDB): Already had users, AI route planning (Gemini via Emergent Integrations), routes CRUD + completion, challenges system, chat, leaderboard, and map helper endpoints (POIs, nearby challenges, route waypoints). These were verified as working in earlier test logs.
- Frontend (Expo + expo-router): Already had a home/index screen with tab-like UI and a Map screen using a placeholder map UI (mobile-first) with working flows to request location and call backend APIs.
- What I added (extensions to align with Prompt/MVP):
  1) Achievements system (DB + APIs) with conditions, rewards, and unlocking flow
  2) Rewards Store (DB + APIs) with claim flow and point deduction
  3) Motivation messages (DB + APIs) and triggers on route/challenge completion
  4) Seed endpoint to quickly bootstrap demo data
  5) Frontend screens for Achievements, Rewards Store, and AI Assistant chat, wired from Home
  6) Integrated achievements + motivation into complete_route and complete_challenge responses so users see instant feedback

Protected files (do not modify)
- frontend/.env (EXPO_TUNNEL_SUBDOMAIN, EXPO_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME, EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL)
- backend/.env (MONGO_URL, DB_NAME, EMERGENT_LLM_KEY)
- frontend/app.json (keep platform settings intact; add extra only if needed)
- frontend/metro.config.js (cache + workers already tuned)
- package.json main field: "expo-router/entry"
- Ports/Ingress: All backend routes must remain prefixed with /api and bound to 0.0.0.0:8001; Frontend served via port 3000; do not hardcode external URLs. Use EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL in frontend.

  - POST /api/seed ‚Üí seeds achievements, rewards, and motivation messages (idempotent)

Backend ‚Äì Files Touched
- backend/server.py
  - Added models: Achievement, RewardItem, MotivationMessage
  - Added utilities: check_and_award_achievements
  - Added routes: /api/achievements*, /api/rewards*, /api/motivation, /api/seed
  - Updated complete_route and complete_challenge to include achievement + motivation in response
  - Emergent Integrations LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro) stays as-is (no extra key from you needed)

Frontend ‚Äì New Screens/Routes (expo-router)
- app/achievements.tsx
  - Lists achievement config with unlocked status per user
  - ‚ÄúCheck‚Äù button posts to /api/achievements/check and refreshes local user + list
- app/rewards.tsx
  - Shows Rewards Store items, lets user claim (deduct points), persists updated user to AsyncStorage
- app/assistant.tsx
  - Minimal AI chat that posts to /api/chat with user context; uses KeyboardAvoidingView and SafeAreaView
- app/index.tsx (updated)
  - Home buttons now deep-link to /rewards, /achievements, /assistant (via expo-router)
  - Route completion alert now surfaces motivation and achievements gained

Environment & Config
- MongoDB: backend/.env already points to mongodb://localhost:27017 and DB_NAME=test_database
- LLM: backend/.env has EMERGENT_LLM_KEY (Emergent universal key) ‚Äì used via emergentintegrations package
- Frontend: frontend/.env provides EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL. Frontend fetches use Constants.expoConfig?.extra?.EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL with fallback to http://localhost:8001. Keep EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL set to your preview domain.
- All API calls must use the /api prefix (Kubernetes ingress rule)

Setup & Run
- Backend
  1) Dependencies are in backend/requirements.txt (emergentintegrations installed during setup)
  2) Service runs at 0.0.0.0:8001
  3) Seed sample data (optional): curl -X POST "$BASE/api/seed"

- Frontend
  1) Ensure frontend/.env has EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL pointing to your preview domain
  2) Start dev: yarn start (or expo start)
  3) Expo Supervisor on this environment showed a spawn error once; if preview doesn‚Äôt auto-refresh, run expo locally or retry supervisor restart. The app code itself is ready.

Testing Notes
- We ran automated backend tests for the new endpoints using the platform testing agent; results:
  - Achievements: working end-to-end
  - Rewards Store: working including insufficient points handling (400)
  - Motivation Messages: working for all triggers
  - Full flow (create user ‚Üí save+complete route ‚Üí points + achievements + motivation ‚Üí leaderboard): working
  - Route waypoints invalid ID returns 500 instead of 400 in one path (minor, non-blocking)
- Frontend testing: per policy, we‚Äôll only run automated UI tests when you ask; manual testing via Expo Go is fine now.

How It Maps to TravelQuest Prompt
- Users: Implemented
- Paths/Journeys vs Routes: We use ‚Äúroutes‚Äù as journeys in MVP
- Tasks/Missions: Implemented as Challenges (photo/food/location/hidden_gem). Can be expanded into separate Tasks table if you prefer
- Achievements: Implemented with unlock conditions + reward points
- Rewards Store: Implemented with cost and point deduction
- Motivation Messages: Implemented with trigger events and randomized messages
- AI Behaviors: Route suggestion + travel assistant chat integrated (Emergent LLM key)

Next Recommended Enhancements (choose any)
- Separate Tasks table distinct from Challenges, with status transitions Not Started/In Progress/Completed
- Dedicated Paths collection with difficulty and AI-suggested flag (and link Tasks)
- Real map rendering (react-native-maps) + Google Maps tiles (needs key) and on-device route traces
- Streak tracker (daily login task + counters) and analytics on Profile
- Dynamic AI task generation endpoint (e.g., /api/tasks/ai-generate) when progressing through route
- Offline caching and optimistic updates with react-query

Quick API Examples
- Complete a route
  PATCH /api/routes/{route_id}/complete?user_id={user_id}
  ‚Üí { message, points_awarded: 50, achievement: { unlocked:[], awarded_points }, motivation: "..." }
- Claim a reward
  POST /api/rewards/claim
  { "user_id": "...", "item_id": "..." }
  ‚Üí 200 OK deducts points and returns updated user and item
- Get motivation
  GET /api/motivation?trigger=task_completed
  ‚Üí { message: "üî• You‚Äôre unstoppable! Keep going!" }

Notes/Limitations
- AI endpoints depend on Emergent LLM budget; if budget is exhausted, AI calls can fail temporarily
- For invalid routeId at /api/routes/{id}/waypoints, one case returns 500 (minor; can patch to 400 if required)

Where to Look in Code
- Backend APIs: /app/backend/server.py
- Frontend routes: /app/frontend/app (index.tsx, achievements.tsx, rewards.tsx, assistant.tsx, map.tsx)

Need From You
- Confirm if you want separate Paths and Tasks tables as per original schema (I can add DB models + APIs + screens)
- Confirm if we should wire real maps (Google Maps) now or keep placeholder for MVP
- If maps now: please provide a Google Maps API key
- Let me know if you want me to run automated frontend tests or you‚Äôll test via Expo Go
