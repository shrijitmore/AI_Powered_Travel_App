TravelQuest AI – Developer Documentation (MVP)

Overview
TravelQuest AI is a gamified travel app with an AI assistant. Users pick or get AI-suggested paths (journeys), complete tasks/missions, earn points, unlock achievements, and claim rewards. The app includes an interactive map experience, motivation messages, leaderboards, and personalization hooks.

Stack
- Frontend: Expo (React Native) + expo-router
- Backend: FastAPI (Uvicorn)
- Database: MongoDB (motor async client)
- AI: Emergent Integrations LLM (Gemini 2.5 Pro)

Protected Configuration – DO NOT MODIFY
- frontend/.env: EXPO_TUNNEL_SUBDOMAIN, EXPO_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME, EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL
- backend/.env: MONGO_URL, DB_NAME, EMERGENT_LLM_KEY
- frontend/app.json: base Expo configuration
- frontend/metro.config.js: Metro cache/workers tuning
- package.json: main field must remain "expo-router/entry"
- URL/Port Rules:
  - Backend binds to 0.0.0.0:8001
  - All backend API routes MUST be prefixed with /api
  - Frontend calls MUST use EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL
  - Ingress forwards /api/* to backend 8001

Quick Start
1) Backend (FastAPI)
- Already managed by supervisor in this environment. If needed locally:

2) Frontend (Expo)
- cd frontend
- yarn install
- expo start (use web, Android, iOS, or Expo Go)
- Ensure frontend/.env contains EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL pointing to the backend ingress domain

Frontend – App Structure (expo-router)
Routes
- / (app/index.tsx)
  - Home tab-like interface
  - Buttons:
    - Explore Map → /map
    - Select Destination | Paths → /paths
    - Plan New Route (calls /api/routes/plan)
    - Complete Demo Route (creates + completes a route)
    - View Rewards → /rewards
    - My Achievements → /achievements
    - Ask AI Assistant → /assistant
- /map (map.tsx) – placeholder map UI with POI and challenges lists for mobile
- /achievements (achievements.tsx)
  - Lists achievements and unlocked status
  - “Check” triggers /api/achievements/check + refresh
- /rewards (rewards.tsx)
  - Lists items from store
  - Claim deducts points and updates AsyncStorage
- /assistant (assistant.tsx)
  - Minimal chat posting to /api/chat with user context
- /paths (paths/index.tsx)
  - Lists paths (calls /api/paths)
  - AI Suggest buttons (Scenic/Shortest/Adventurous) → /api/paths/suggest
  - Opens /paths/[id]
- /paths/[id] (paths/[id].tsx)
  - Path info + tasks
  - Task transitions Not Started → In Progress → Completed
  - Completing awards points, triggers motivation + achievements refresh

Mobile UX Concerns
- SafeAreaView used across screens
- KeyboardAvoidingView in assistant.tsx
- Minimum 44x touch targets for buttons
- No absolute-positioned main content
- Platform differences handled via Platform.select and conditional padding

Environment Variables & URLs
- Backend
  - backend/.env → MONGO_URL, DB_NAME, EMERGENT_LLM_KEY (do not print or commit real keys)
  - Service binds to 0.0.0.0:8001
  - All routes use /api prefix
- Frontend
  - frontend/.env → EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL points to the ingress domain
  - In code: Constants.expoConfig?.extra?.EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL (fallback to http://localhost:8001)

Workflows
1) Start Journey
- User opens /paths → selects an AI-suggested or existing path → starts tasks
- Alternatively: plan route → save → complete

2) Task Completion
- Update task status to Completed → user gets reward_points → motivational message returned → achievements auto-checked and possibly unlocked with bonus points

3) Reward Claim
- Visit Rewards → claim item if points sufficient → points deducted → item added to inventory

4) AI Assistant
- /assistant posts question with user context to /api/chat
- /api/paths/suggest generates journeys based on goal (scenic/shortest/adventurous)

Testing & Protocol
- test_result.md contains testing protocol (DO NOT EDIT THE PROTOCOL SECTION)
- Backend tests have been run via platform testing agent; endpoints verified
- Frontend UI tests can be run on request (Playwright in CI or manual testing in Expo Go)
- Manual smoke test checklist:
  - Create user on first app launch
  - Seed data (optional)
  - Open Paths; AI suggest; open a path → complete a task → verify points and achievements
  - Plan route; complete route → verify points and motivation
  - Claim a reward → verify points deduction and inventory

AI Integration Notes
- Uses Emergent Integrations – LlmChat with model (gemini-2.5-pro)
- No extra keys required by you in this environment (EMERGENT_LLM_KEY configured)
- Budget: If AI budget is exhausted, AI endpoints may return an error; core logic is resilient and still functions

Known Minor Issue
- For invalid route IDs at /api/routes/{id}/waypoints, in one execution path HTTP 500 may be returned instead of 400. This is non-blocking but can be patched quickly if needed.

Roadmap / Next Enhancements
- Real map (react-native-maps) with polylines, markers, and Google Maps tiles (needs an API key)
- Streak tracker (daily login) + analytics charts on Profile
- Personalization loop (suggest based on user history and preferences); per-user suggestions via /api/paths/suggest that use user history
- Offline caching and background refresh with @tanstack/react-query
- Push notifications (expo-notifications) for streaks and task reminders
- Advanced leaderboard (friends-only, weekly, monthly)

Troubleshooting
- Expo dependency version warnings: The environment may suggest specific versions; the app works with current versions. Update only if needed and test thoroughly.
- AI budget exceeded: Retry later or add budget to Emergent Universal Key.
- 500 vs 400 on route waypoints invalid ID: non-blocking; can be patched on request.
